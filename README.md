# I'm learning AI from scratch, the hard way!

![diagram](./assets/diagram.svg)

Welcome to my repo! I am learning AI & ML with Andrej Karpathy, from scratch, and so should you.

Everything in this repo is built from **first principles**. No ML frameworks like PyTorch or Tensorflow allowed! 

The goal is to establish a robust and conceptual understanding of neural networks. 

## Prerequisites:
- Rudimentary python and numpy
- Introductory derivatives.
- Basic algebra.

**Useful links:**
- Here is a link for the YouTube playlist containing all the videos, ordered by dependence: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)

## Why this exists

I am transitioning from a PhD in pure maths (you can learn more about it [here]([diogofd](https://diogofd.github.io/)) into AI & ML, so this repo is used for:
- Furthering my code fluency and habits.
- Sharpening my understading of core tenets of NNs from the ground up.
- Building a documented foundation for deeper AI research ot engineering work.

Hopefully, this repository gets to serve a purpose beyond helping me get attention from recruitment teams, and actually benefits other academia outbound folks!

Everyting you read is fully annotated by me.
